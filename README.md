# Pos-tagger
It tries to tag each word of a sentence with its corresponding part of speech

# How to run this
Download the test.txt,train.txt and tags along with the actual program file pos.py.

Place them in the same directory and run them

# New features to come
For now the tagger only works on the test.txt data and also tags are in the  form not normally used by humans.

Gonna change the tags back to the normal human tagging form and also will enable human input
